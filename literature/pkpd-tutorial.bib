  abstract      = {Modeling is an important tool in drug development; population modeling is a complex process requiring robust underlying procedures for ensuring clean data, appropriate computing platforms, adequate resources, and effective communication. Although requiring an investment in resources, it can save time and money by providing a platform for integrating all information gathered on new therapeutic agents. This article provides a brief overview of aspects of modeling and simulation as applied to many areas in drug development.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2012) 1, e6; doi:10.1038/psp.2012.4; advance online publication 26 September 2012.},
